# Specification 'rch-rdh'

**ARCHIVED:** The [W3C RDF Canonicalization and Hash WG](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/rch) originally intended to work on two Rec Track documents: [RDF Dataset Canonicalization](https://github.com/w3c/rdf-canon/), and [RDF Dataset Hash](https://github.com/w3c/rch-rdh). This repository here was created to work on the latter. However, on 29 March 2023 the WG passed a resolution that it will produce only a single Rec Track document which will cover both topics.

This RDF Dataset Canonicalization specification is here:
- https://github.com/w3c/rdf-canon/ (Github repo)
- https://w3c.github.io/rdf-canon/spec/ (HTML)

The WG resolution is here:
- https://www.w3.org/2023/03/29-rch-minutes.html#ResolutionSummary

Therefore, this repository here has been archived.
